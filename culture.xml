  <description>&lt;p&gt;You may not find many in business, universities, Congress or the Chief Justice of the United States’s office, but there are still Catholics out there willing to defend the Church, decency and civilization. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <title>.@amandaseales Hosts BET Awards, 'Black Everything,' 'Karen-Free'</title>
  <link>https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/culture/julie-mitchell/2020/06/29/bet-awards-host-imitates-karens-racist-skit</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;Just when you thought the BET awards could not get any more woke, the host performs a skit on video chat, pretending to be a white woman afraid of black people. But then again, what is the best way for BET to make their fan base feel victimized, while simultaneously promoting the marxist Black Lives Matter movement? &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;As American society continues to convulse over the demands of politically-divisive, race-baiting groups like Black Lives Matter, one prominent TV network decided that showcasing a full speech from black supremacist and anti-semite Louis Farrakhan on the 4th of July would be a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus pandemic is doing strange things to awards shows. The shows, including the acceptance speeches, are pre-taped and shown virtually which makes for less spontaneous lectures from our woke betters in the entertainment world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Starz’s Hightown has it all. June 28’s episode, "Everybody’s Got a Cousin" contains the random opportunity to mention “global warming” and curse President Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the episode, fisherman Michael McCarthy (Michael Park) joins in on bashing Trump when Jackie Quiñones, an officer of the National Marine Fisheries Services, comes sniffing around his boat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

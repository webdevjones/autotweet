  <title>The vicious anti-Trump media is doing everything they can to pump up Joe Biden </title>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Lefty reporters and hosts have devoted the last two weeks to depicting Donald Trump as a racially divisive President who is going to get “everybody” killed from coronavirus, while portraying Joe Biden as the enlightened alternative to the President’s message of “hate.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <title>WITHOUT EVIDENCE: CNN's @BrianStelter set up Bill Moyers to smear Trump rally-goers as wanting journalists lynched. </title>
  <link>https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/tim-graham/2020/06/29/so-cnn-stelter-sets-moyers-smear-trump-fans-wanting-reporters-dead</link>
  <description>&lt;p&gt;On CNN’s Reliable Sources on Sunday, Brian Stelter lamented that Facebook was “radicalizing” people with allowing all this divisive speech on its platform. Then he welcomed on longtime PBS omnipresence Bill Moyers, who suggested it was a popular T-shirt at Trump rallies to suggest journalists should be lynched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First Stelter lamented Trump using the “racist” term “Kung Flu,” and asked Moyers “Have you ever seen as a former White House Press Secretary yourself such a personal, hostile relationship between reporters and government officials?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus pandemic is doing strange things to awards shows. The shows, including the acceptance speeches, are pre-taped and shown virtually which makes for less spontaneous lectures from our woke betters in the entertainment world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
